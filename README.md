# Budget Planner README

## Overview

The **Budget Planner** is a personal finance management application that allows users to manage their finances efficiently. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete user profiles, track their income, expenses, and savings goals, and generate detailed reports. The tool also provides a feature to calculate the duration needed for users to reach their savings goals based on their current financial situation.

The data is stored in a CSV file, which allows for easy reading and writing of user information. The application maintains an activity log for tracking user actions.

## Error Handling

- The application performs input validation for the email format and checks for existing email addresses.
- If an invalid number is entered for income, expenses, or savings goal, the user will be prompted to enter a valid positive number.
- If an operation (e.g., viewing or updating users) fails due to missing or incorrect data, appropriate error messages are displayed.

---

## Activity Log

Every action taken by the user is logged and can be viewed in the activity log. For example:

- User creation
- User update
- User deletion
- Report generation
- Calculation of savings duration
- Application exit

The activity log is saved in the memory and displayed when generating a report.
